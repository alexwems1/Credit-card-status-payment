In this project, Machine Learning techniques are used to predict the credit card payment status of a set of customers. 


This dataset is avaible in  [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset).
The variables of the dataset are:


-   CREDIT ID: Identifier of each client. LIMIT BAL: Credit Line Amount
-   SEX: Gender (1=male, 2=female)
-   EDUCATION: (1=high school, 2=college, 3= Middle School, 4=other, 5=unknown, 6=unknown)
-   MARRIAGE: Marital status (1=married, 2=single, 3=other)
-   AGE: Age in years
-   DEFAULT - Default payment next month (Yes=1, No=0)
-   PAST_PAY - History of repayment status
    -   PAST_PAY1 = the repayment status in September 2005
    -   PAST_PAY2 = the repayment status in August 2005
    -   PAST_PAY6 = the repayment status in April 2005
    -   The measurement scale for the repayment status is i. -1 = pay duly  
        ii. 1 = payment delay for one month  
        iii. 2 = payment delay for two months  
        iv. 8 = payment delay for eight months  
        v. 9 = payment delay for nine months and above  
        
-   BILL_AMT- Amount of bill statement (INR)
    -   BILL_AMT1 = amount of bill statement in September 2005
    -   BILL_AMT2 = amount of bill statement in August 2005
    -   BILL_AMT6 = amount of bill statement in April 2005
-   PAY_AMT - Amount of previous payment (INR)
    -   PAY_AMT1 = amount paid in September 2005
    -   PAY_AMT2 = amount paid in August 2005
    -   PAY_AMT6 = amount paid in April 2005
A preliminary data analysis is performed to know the distribution and the improvements to be made to the data set.
